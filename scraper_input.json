The main criterion used to determine whether a downturn following one business cycle peak and apparent trough is a separate recession or the continuation of the earlier one is the duration and strength of the upturn after the initial trough. For example, our determination that the recession that began in 1981 was separate [...] A: There are several reasons. First, we do not identify economic activity solely with real GDP, but consider a range of indicators. Second, we consider the depth of the decline in economic activity. The NBER definition includes the phrase, “a significant decline in economic activity.\"Thus real GDP could decline by relatively small amounts in two consecutive quarters without warranting the determination that a peak had occurred. Third, our main focus is on the monthly chronology, which requires [...] A: The NBER does not separately identify depressions in its business cycle chronology. The period between a peak and a trough is a contraction or a recession, and the period between the trough and the peak is an expansion. The term depression is often used to refer to a particularly severe period of economic weakness. Some economists use it to refer only to the portion of these periods when economic activity is declining. The more common use, however, also encompasses the time until economic",

Technical Definition of Recession NBER defines recession as a “significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months,” but it does not have a set numerical formula to determine a recession. Instead, NBER evaluates three criteria—depth, diffusion, and duration—using a variety of monthly economic indicators including income, [...] employment, consumption, sales, and industrial production. An outsized impact to one criterion can make up for a weaker impact to another. For example, in July 2021, NBER declared the United States to have been in a recession from March to April 2020 owing to the extreme drop in economic activity, despite the brevity of the contraction. Because NBER considers length and depth of economic downturns in determining recessions, it dates recessions and expansions with a lag. The length of the lag is [...] more information about recessions and their causes, see CRS Report R47479, Common Causes of Economic Recession, by Lida R. Weinstock.

Further, whether or not a policy stance, specific event, or trend in the economy results in recession is context dependent. However, there are certain fairly common causes of recession in the United States. This report provides an overview of recessions and discusses some common causes, [...] The proximate causes of recession are many and varied. Any number of events can send the economy toward recession by affecting aggregate demand, aggregate supply, or both. Sometimes determining a single causal event is not possible—the belief by consumers and businesses that the economy may slow in the near future can result in large enough behavior changes to result in recession. Oftentimes, however, economists can point to a specific event. A few of those most common causes of recession in [...] Recessions are the result of shocks to aggregate supply or aggregate demand in the economy or both. A supply shock occurs when something reduces the economy's ability to produce output at a given price level. A demand shock occurs when something reduces businesses' and households' willingness to consume and invest at a given price level. Supply-induced recessions tend to be characterized by decreased output and increased prices, while demand-induced recessions tend to be characterized by both",

      "snippet": "Uncertainty could comove contemporaneously with real activity both because it is an exogenous impulse driving business cycles and because it responds endogenously to ﬁrst moment shocks. Recursive structures explicitly rule this out, since they presume that some variables respond only with a lag to others. Other commonly used VAR identiﬁcation strategies, such as sign restrictions, long-run restrictions, and instrumental variables estimation, are likewise problematic, as we discuss further [...] Second, the results suggest that sharply higher macro and policy uncertainty in recessions is best characterized as an endogenous response to business cycle ﬂuctuations. That is, negative economic activity shocks are found to cause increases in both macro and policy uncertainty, but there is less evidence that positive shocks to macro or policy uncertainty cause lower economic activity. Indeed, in most estimations the opposite is true: exogenous shocks to macro and policy uncertainty are found [...] A second strand of the literature postulates that higher macro uncertainty arises solely as a response to lower economic growth. In these theories there is no exogenous uncertainty shock at all and all uncertainty variation is endogenous.

By the end of the recession in November 1982, unemployment had surged to twelve million, with marked increases in manufacturing and construction [...] The high interest rates were responsible for a sharp decline in purchases of new homes and automobiles. Consumer spending on such items as furniture and household equipment (durable goods) as well as home construction is responsive to interest rates. These expenditure declines were major causes of the sixteen-month recession that began in July, 1981, and resulted in an increase in unemployment to the highest levels since 1941.\n\n## The 1981-1982 Recession [...] There were two recessions during the 1980’s. The first occurred from January to July, 1980. The second began in July, 1981, and lasted through November, 1982. Following a period of little economic growth in 1979, overall economic activity declined in early 1980.
