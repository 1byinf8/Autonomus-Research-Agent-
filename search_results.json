Some are associated with sharp changes in the prices of the inputs used in producing goods and services. For example, a steep increase in oil prices can be a harbinger of a recession. As energy becomes expensive, it pushes up the overall price level, leading to a decline in aggregate demand. A recession can also be triggered by a country\u2019s [...] Other recessions, such as the one that began in 2007, are rooted in financial market problems. Sharp increases in asset prices and a speedy expansion of credit often coincide with rapid accumulation of debt.

Not all such credit booms end up in recessions, but when they do, these recessions are [...] Because recessions have many potential causes, it is a challenge to predict them. The behavioral patterns of numerous economic variables\u2014including credit volume, asset prices, and the unemployment rate\u2014around recessions have been documented, but although they might be the cause of recessions, they could also be the result of recessions\u2014or in economic parlance, endogenous to recessions.

Although they played a large role in these recessions, the oil shocks were not the sole contributing factors to the recessions, and oil shocks have not been the primary cause of recessions since then owing to a variety of factors, including increased domestic production and the buildup of oil reserves.10 The U.S. economy is continually experiencing various supply shocks, but most are not significant enough to cause a recession.

Consumer spending on such items as furniture and household equipment (durable goods) as well as home construction is responsive to interest rates.

Further, whether or not a policy stance, specific event, or trend in the economy results in recession is context dependent. However, there are certain fairly common causes of recession in the United States. This report provides an overview of recessions and discusses some common causes, [...] The financial crisis that began in 2007 led to one of the longest recorded U.S. recessions, often nicknamed the \"Great Recession\" owing to its deep and prolonged nature, followed by a sluggish economic recovery. The financial crisis was precipitated by a housing market crash. In the lead up there was a housing bubble, where prices rose rapidly and unsustainably, mortgage borrowing increased, and underwriting standards deteriorated. As the housing market turned and home prices fell, financial [...] While supply shocks can come from anywhere in supply chains, typically shocks to inputs of the production process that are integral to production across the economy are the most likely to result in recession. For example, oil shocks are one of the most common causes of supply-related recession, as oil products (and other sources of energy) are used in the production of nearly all goods and services within the United States in addition to being a direct-to-consumer commodity.

Notably, a prediction model that includes the unemployment rate and inflation rate, in addition to the term spread, [...] Another approach to assessing recession risk considers leading indicators identified by economists (e.g., Berge, 2015).
